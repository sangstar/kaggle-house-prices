## Kaggle House Prices Competition

Submission for [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) Kaggle competition. I can improve this score with a more exhaustive grid search, trying a gradboost regressor, and experimenting with different cutoff values for cosine similarity -- possibly could tune it as a hyperparameter.
